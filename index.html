                        Hi, my name is Erica Young! Never in a million years would I have thought I would be living my dream. After graduating from college 
                        with a degree in education, I thought I had it all figured out. I would spend my life molding the minds of our future leaders. Overtime, 
                        I discovered that my passion for teaching was driven by the challenges, ever changing environment, and the continuous growth that I 
                        experienced.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After facilitating several after school coding clubs, I realized that I enjoyed coding just as much as my students. Eventually, coding 
                        become more than a fun hobby on the side. It was something I did on the weekends, and during the by summers off. The time I spend coding, 
                        helped me to realized that I had discover a new passion, that would challenge me even more than teaching. 
                        </p>

                            In June of 2019, I was given the opportunity to develop my understanding of programing, by attending a coding bootcamp. This was my chance to become 
                            fully immersed in the world of technology. This course challenged me in ways, my former elementary students had never challenge me.
